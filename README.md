Racing bar chart using racely

In this project, I aimed to explore the economic growth of different CIS states (excluding Russia) following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Additionally, I wanted to assess Python's capabilities in creating animated visuals (conclusion: it's not the best).

To achieve this, I gathered data from the World Bank's Databank and performed data cleaning using Pandas. Subsequently, I utilized Plotly and the Racely extension to generate a racing bar chart, visualizing the economic trends. In instances where data was unavailable (such as Moldova before 1995 and Turkmenistan from 2021 to 2023), it was substituted with a value of 0.
